## When we’ll publish your lesson
You’ve made it to the finish line. Hooray!

Once you’ve uploaded your lesson and gotten the official thumbs up, your lesson enters egghead’s lesson publishing queue.

The queue automatically publishes lessons from top to bottom. We publish several times per week and sometimes daily, depending on how many lessons are in the queue. This way, we make sure we’re keeping our subscribers happy with a steady stream of great content.


### New instructors

Lucky you—we move new instructors’ lessons to the top of the queue. This gives you a quick win after going through the process of recording your 30-second sample, making edits, recording your lesson for real, making *more* edits, and finally getting that coveted approval.

You’ve come a long way. Celebrate!


### Experienced instructors

When an instructor has 12 published lessons, they gain the ability to review, approve, and publish their own content! Hot damn!

We trust you to make sure the quality of your lesson is high. You can still ask for review if you want it, or you can simply add your lesson to the publishing queue by approving it like a baller.


### Sharing your lesson on social media

After publishing, lessons are added to egghead’s social media sharing queue. This drives a lot of eyeballs to our lessons—our Twitter account has over 45,000 followers.


### That’s it!

You did it. You’re a published instructor.
