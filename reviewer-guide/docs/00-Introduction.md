## Overview

egghead.io content must be constantly reviewed to ensure that it is up to date so that members are delivered learning materials that help them meet their personal and professional goals.

To accomplish this, humans must watch the lesson videos, follow the instructions, and make the code work. Often the content in the video will become out of date because of the nature of software. New versions are released constantly. In addition to video content, we provide and maintain text based code content with the lessons. Unlike the videos, this code content can be updated and maintained by a lesson reviewer.


### Standard operating procedures:

  1. Watch the lesson video.
  2. Review the lesson code for consistency with the video.
  3. Update the lesson code to latest versions of the main libraries/tools that are central to the lesson.
  4. Note any major differences (add code comments as required)
  5. If discrepancies are major, seek a second opinion.
  6. If issues can’t be salvaged, add a warning on the lesson (errata) and notify review team lead for next steps.

### Build Strong Context

In addition to these steps, we want to ensure that the lessons have strong titles, meaningful tags associated with them, have a transcript, and maintain the software versions presented to the user.

We want the support copy (titles and description) to add context to the lesson so that the lesson can stay laser focused on a single topic. The [egghead.io instructor guide](https://instructor.egghead.io/guide/02-Creating-Lessons/04-what-should-I-teach.html#clearly-summarize-the-lessons) defines exactly what we want from a description. The guide in general is great for understanding what we want from lessons. 

### Review Documents

When the review is complete, notes should be compiled into a lesson review report including any links to updated code and recommendations. When these notes have been reviewed and approved, the lesson will be updated accordingly.

A large portion of the content on egghead.io is in courses. Courses consist of a series of individual lessons, so for the most part, reviewing a course is a repetition of the steps above for the individual lessons. As with individual lesson review, a course review will produce a report that will be shared with the review team lead for feedback before implementing any changes.

### Tools for Reviewing

While specific knowledge of the frameworks and libraries being taught on egghead isn’t required, a working knowledge of basic programming concepts is required. The majority of our lessons are aimed at JavaScript developers, and we don’t cater to beginners. 

We utilize git extensively, so a working knowledge of the tool is required. Generally speaking we will use Github. Git is used to maintain transcripts and lesson code.

We also use several “live” code tools. Plunker is the primary tool we use for the purpose of displaying working code examples in the browser.
