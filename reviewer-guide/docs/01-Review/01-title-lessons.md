## [How Do I…] Standard

The title of the video needs to reflect the question that is answered in the video.  Finishing the `How do I…` question is a great way to accomplish this and is the standard for our lessons.

This is a standard that we have adopted recently so many of our older lessons and courses do not have this standard applied and need to be updated accordingly.

Another way to think about the title of a video is that it is the summary of the description (of the video). If the summary answers the question the title proposes, you are on the right track.

Our titles are also one of the main resources we use for exposing our content to the internet. We want to include the technology that the lesson is covering in the title.

Here's a list of lesson title examples and how we updated the titles to our new standard.

### Old Title

- Filters
- Observables are almost like Functions
- Creation operator: of()
- Understand Elm’s Bool Type

### Updated Title

- Filter Input in AngularJS
- Return Multiple Values with Observables in RxJS
- Deliver Synchronous Values with the RxJS of() Operator
- Pattern Match Expressions with Elm’s Boolean Type
