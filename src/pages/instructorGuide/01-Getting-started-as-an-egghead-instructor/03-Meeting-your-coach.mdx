## Meeting your coach

Your success as an instructor is the #1 priority at egghead—and we know success doesn’t come without support. You’ll need some guidance to create the world-class screencasts our members expect. That’s why we pair you with an egghead coach right when you start.

Your coach is a seasoned instructor who will help you nail egghead style through ongoing support, feedback, and brainstorming. Got questions? #ask! Big stuff, little stuff, rough drafts, fire away.

Slack with your coach to:

- Brainstorm [lesson ideas](/what-should-you-teach)
- Solidify the theme, scope, and goals of a code example
- Get a second pair of eyes before uploading screencasts
- Talk through feedback
- Get answers on administrative stuff like contracts, equipment, etc.

Even after you’ve published a few lessons, your coach is available whenever you need them.

Plus, you can reach out to egghead's founders John Lindquist (@john) and Joel Hooks (@joel) with any questions or concerns. John and Joel are 100% dedicated to you and the rest of the egghead instructors. Slack us!
