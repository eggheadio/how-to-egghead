## Joining Slack

![05_slack_eggos](../../../images/illustrations/ch1_s2_joining-slack.png)

Slack is where we communicate.

Once you’ve [signed up](http://egghead.io/) for egghead and created your instructor profile, you’ll receive an invitation to [our Slack channel](/egghead-on-slack). That’s where you can meet other instructors from all over the world, talk shop, and get all the support you need from the egghead team. As an instructor, you have access to the egghead Slack for life. Bring your best emoji game.

When you join Slack, we’ll create your private instructor channel. That’s where we’ll share feedback with you, hash out lesson ideas, and answer any questions you have.

When in doubt, Slack!
