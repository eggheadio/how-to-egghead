# Our contributor agreement

![eggo_signing_contract](../../../images/illustrations/ch5_s1_signingcontract.png)

egghead has a [standard contributor agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jNT6R6SNb9OVYSnpTDqevMh80XZ8Gu3VeYoLZck0v4/edit) that we provide to all instructors. The agreement protects egghead from any mischief you might cause; leaves all ownership rights to you, the creator; and lays out the terms for payment. You sign it, we sign it, we shake on it.

We like to maintain respectful, easygoing, rewarding relationships with our contributors. This agreement allows everyone to happily work together for years on end.
