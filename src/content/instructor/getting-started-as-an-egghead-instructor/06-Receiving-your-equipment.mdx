## Receiving your equipment

If you’re looking at your laptop and wondering how you’ll juke the microphone settings to create professional-quality sound quality...no need. We got you!

Once you've created a draft lesson that is _almost_ ready to be published, we’ll ship you a case packed with audio recording toys. With our compliments, of course.

You’ll get:

- K & M 23150-500-55 Tabletop Microphone Stand with 5/8" Threaded Connector and Mini Boom Arm
- Shure BETA 87A Microphone
- Shock Mount to attach the mic to the stand
- Shure X2U XLR-to-USB Signal Adapter
- 1 XLR Cable to connect the Microphone to the USB Interface
- Badass by Kathy Sierra

Our [technical guide](/set-up-your-audio) covers setup and how each item works.
