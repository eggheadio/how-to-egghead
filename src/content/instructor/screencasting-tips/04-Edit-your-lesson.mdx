# Edit your lesson

Editing is your lesson‚Äôs critical last stop between you and your audience. It‚Äôs your quality filter.

### Ripple delete

‚ö°Ô∏èRipple delete is your greatest ally. ‚ö°Ô∏è It‚Äôs basically deleting the bad parts, a chunk of seconds at a time‚Äîlike that tangent you go on, that five-second period where you stammer over a word, and those dozens of ‚Äúumm‚Äùs and ‚Äúlike‚Äùs you had no idea you said so often. Ripple delete couldn‚Äôt be easier or more essential, and it‚Äôs available in both Camtasia and Screenflow. üôå

In the egghead lesson shown below, John Lindquist shows how he uses ripple delete to trim a video from 7:28 to 2:17. Yes, really.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è speed up/slow down video

Sometimes you want to speed over some unimportant parts or slow down important parts. You can do this in a controlled percentage wide format in Screenflow ([instructions here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu4b-ECFAYk)).

Alternatively, you can do it interactively by holding down `Option` while dragging the edges of a clip to do the same thing. Sped up clips will show a :rabbit2: and slowed clips will have a :turtle:. This is handy for stretching or shrinking a clip to be a specific size, **and** you can do it with multiple clips at once.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è annotate video

You can annotate your videos with arrows and boxes by using the Annotations tool in the top right in the inspector pane.

They act like regular video clips so you can fade them in and out, apply animations, etc.

### Editing with Premiere

In time, you can üí• kick it up a notch üí• with more sophisticated editing software like Adobe Premiere. Premiere has some significant advantages, but it also has a steep learning curve. We recommend starting simple, and leveling up to a non-linear editing system like Premiere later. If you‚Äôre interested, see how some of our advanced instructors use Premiere:

### The easiest way to edit is to capture it well

In traditional videography, ‚Äúin-camera editing‚Äù refers to the idea of capturing content so well, it doesn‚Äôt need to be edited much at all.

Your first few lessons will feel like a major effort to produce because you have to consider so many different things. You‚Äôre teaching complex concepts (web development) and learning complex concepts (screencasting) at the same time.

Believe us: You‚Äôll get better. And better. And better. Just keep practicing and keep recording.
