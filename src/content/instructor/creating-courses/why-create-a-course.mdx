# Course Production

We are currently updating the process for creating courses on egghead. In the past we've asked that instructors produce proposals and outlines without significant input from egghead.

Going forward we want to provide more assitance and collaboration for producing new courses on egghead.

If you've got a course idea, we want to hear about it and schedule a video chat to explore it more with you.
