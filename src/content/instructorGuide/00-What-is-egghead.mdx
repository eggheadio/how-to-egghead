# What is egghead?

egghead.io is a community where web developers learn from each other through short lessons and courses teaching the tools of our trade.

Our instructors hail from every continent but Antartica. (That’s next.) egghead instructors are platform-agnostic, learning-enthusiastic, and badass by definition, however they define it.

egghead was created by a small team of web developers who know how essential it is to keep learning. There’s always a new tool or framework to figure out. We made egghead so the experts can create lessons to share their knowledge with people who need it.

Have 10 spare minutes? You can learn a skill.

Have a skill? You can be an instructor (and [get paid](/getting-paid) for it).

### What are lessons like?

egghead lessons are bite-sized, practice-ready video tutorials for busy web developers.

Every egghead lesson consists of a single screencast that’s 1–10 minutes long. You’ll record your screen as you talk through [a code example](/create-your-code-example), just like you’re explaining how you solved a problem to a coworker. The goal of each lesson is to give learners a specific piece of knowledge they can use right away.

There’s an art to [teaching concepts as an egghead instructor](/how-to-instruct), but you don’t need to be nervous or shy. Just be yourself, no matter who you are or what your lesson is about. Just be sure to [edit out](/edit-your-lesson) the “umm”s and “uhh”s.

### What makes egghead different?

We believe variety is the spice of learning. No two people learn the same way, so no one person can be the de facto teacher of anything. You’ll find two, sometimes three egghead lessons covering the very same topic. If one lesson doesn’t offer a breakthrough moment for a learner, we bet another will.

So if your dream [topic is already taken](/what-if-a-lesson-already-exists), it’s not taken at all. Go ahead, press record, and share what you know from your perspective.
