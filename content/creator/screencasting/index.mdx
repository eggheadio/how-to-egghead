# Record your lesson

Screencasting is one of those iceberg-like tasks: 90% of the work is behind the scenes. Only 10% is visible.

![iceberg](./images/ch4_s3_iceberg.png)

The final edited version of your screencast is that 10%. 

You’ve put tons of thought and time into your lesson scope, code example, and points you want to cover. What distinguishes your success in this final stage is high-quality technical tools. (And careful editing—that’s next.)

### Video capture

egghead.io instructors are provided with whatever software licenses you need. Just #ask!

**On Windows**, the best option for video capture and editing is [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html).

**On a Mac**, the best options are [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) and [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html). Both provide editing features. We tend to prefer ScreenFlow for its standalone simplicity, as Joe Maddalone shows in the video show below, but the decision is completely yours.

### Capturing audio

There are three ways to record your screencasts. Each is completely 👌

- All at once
- Audio first, video second
- Video first, audio second

**All at once** is arguably the simplest approach—just type and record the screen. You don't have to think about the video and audio separately. You just have to think about them at the same time, which might be a lot to ask. Give it a try and see how it feels to you!

**Audio first** means you play back the audio and record your video to match. The trick here is remembering what is said when, so your mouse is ready to move where it needs to.

**Video first** means you narrate over video playback. It can be challenging to sync and get a natural feeling with narration. Like most things, it takes practice.

For more on audio, see our guide to [audio setup](/set-up-your-audio).

### Record one thought at a time

While you’re recording, do your editing-self a favor: Record in short, high-quality chunks, one thought at a time.

Think of your lesson as a series of paragraphs that take 20 seconds to record. **Between each, take a pause**. Doing this will help you avoid intense editing to move audio and video snippets around as you build your quilt-like final product.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/GJycRLp6zYGFq/giphy.gif)

When you record in chunks, you get better short takes. (You’re not trying to set a record for the longest unedited take here.) By pausing between each section, you can visibly see where you need to [ripple delete](/edit-your-lesson).

Need an example? Watch John Lindquist show how to record one thought at a time:

# Edit your lesson

Editing is your lesson’s critical last stop between you and your audience. It’s your quality filter.

### Ripple delete

⚡️Ripple delete is your greatest ally. ⚡️ It’s basically deleting the bad parts, a chunk of seconds at a time—like that tangent you go on, that five-second period where you stammer over a word, and those dozens of “umm”s and “like”s you had no idea you said so often. Ripple delete couldn’t be easier or more essential, and it’s available in both Camtasia and Screenflow. 🙌

In the egghead lesson shown below, John Lindquist shows how he uses ripple delete to trim a video from 7:28 to 2:17. Yes, really.

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-edit-with-ripple-delete/embed" />

## ⚡️ speed up/slow down video

Sometimes you want to speed over some unimportant parts or slow down important parts. You can do this in a controlled percentage wide format in Screenflow ([instructions here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu4b-ECFAYk)).

Alternatively, you can do it interactively by holding down `Option` while dragging the edges of a clip to do the same thing. Sped up clips will show a :rabbit2: and slowed clips will have a :turtle:. This is handy for stretching or shrinking a clip to be a specific size, **and** you can do it with multiple clips at once.

![stretch clip time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/52251445-fb72e480-28a0-11e9-8b32-304670ce2e0e.gif)

## ⚡️ annotate video

You can annotate your videos with arrows and boxes by using the Annotations tool in the top right in the inspector pane.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/52251395-ad5de100-28a0-11e9-9b18-e80056582711.png)

They act like regular video clips so you can fade them in and out, apply animations, etc.

### Editing with Premiere

In time, you can 💥 kick it up a notch 💥 with more sophisticated editing software like Adobe Premiere. Premiere has some significant advantages, but it also has a steep learning curve. We recommend starting simple, and leveling up to a non-linear editing system like Premiere later. If you’re interested, see how some of our advanced instructors use Premiere:

- [Voiceover and editing with Joel Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faINApx4-4g&list=PL219naRJXQKbQJ60WxsuGfTFv7_fvna51&index=2)

### The easiest way to edit is to capture it well

In traditional videography, “in-camera editing” refers to the idea of capturing content so well, it doesn’t need to be edited much at all.

Your first few lessons will feel like a major effort to produce because you have to consider so many different things. You’re teaching complex concepts (web development) and learning complex concepts (screencasting) at the same time.

Believe us: You’ll get better. And better. And better. Just keep practicing and keep recording.

Need help or advice? Please, #ask! You aren’t the first person to do this or struggle at it. Your coach and the other friendly folks on Slack were all in your shoes once, and now we’re here to help you succeed.

# Sharing your code

Playing around with code is critical to becoming a better web developer.

For every egghead lesson, we provide a concise, organized, readable code example below the lesson video in a runnable embed, using Plunker or a similar service. That way, egghead members can jump in right away.

Note: You should always record in a local environment using your favorite text editor, and then repurpose your code using Plunker or your service of choice. You do you!

### Using Plunker

Plunker allows us to embed even fairly complex apps as runnable examples, perfect for our learners to run with. There are two ways to use it:

- You’ll typically use **Plunker’s public UI** and set up your code example there. For standalone lessons, feel free to just do this. It works great.
- Plunker also supports loading your code **directly into the embed via Github**. This is an amazing feature that allows us to version control the examples presented to the user. egghead can then handle maintenance on your examples and keep them updated and supported for a much longer time. :muscle:

Much as we love Plunker, there are cases where it just won’t work. In those cases, simply link to a GitHub repository.

### Link a Plunker embed to a GitHub repo

Linking a GitHub repository to Plunker is fairly simple and involves configuring the Plunker embed url. We start with https://embed.plnkr.co/ , which is the base embed url. To link to Github we configure the url by adding:

`https://embed.plnkr.co/github/{profile-name}/{repository}/{branch}``

`{branch}` can be replaced with `{tag|sha1}` depending on how your repo is set up. If your repo is set up with an example in individual folders, you can add that `/path` to the embed url.

[Here’s an example Github repo](https://github.com/eggheadio-projects/nlp-in-javascript-with-natural), which is divided into one folder per lesson.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BN85gMdmTnjYqHeoEwsHzjtXWp-ihYBBQULZI4C6tz0jmyhGGTjnkHwEOiYqTMn3w28D7bvq9Lvgixz5QdBtQM8mfs7V1vfOgYiRQIaahBfd22lcHBqEqARyqgWhzPib478Gmgz2)

### Additional Plunker embed config

URL parameters can be added to affect how the embed presents itself. The most-used feature is showing specific files (the default being the index and preview). Add `?show=` to the end of the url with the various filenames separated by commas.

`https://embed.plnkr.co/github/eggheadio-projects/egghead-wikipedia-demo/angular-2-building`

You’ll see a complex example of this [here](https://embed.plnkr.co/github/eggheadio-projects/egghead-wikipedia-demo/angular-2-building-an-instant-search-with-angular-2-combining-observables-with-flatmap?preview=plnkr.html&show=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts,preview).

If you want to go wild, [this gist documents](https://ggoodman.gitbooks.io/plunker/content/embed.html) quite a few additional parameters you can use.

### Build complex apps in Plunker

Before you go any further, **stop!** You don’t need to build apps in Plunker. egghead will do this for you. Just hit up @zac in Slack and we’ll get to it.

...but if you’re the DIY type, this is actually pretty cool.

Plunker itself doesn’t support the node file system—import and export statements in Plunker will not work. But it is possible to create an in-browser Typescript compiler. This is usually required for Angular lesson examples. Doing this takes a bit of set up, so hang in there!

Here’s what you do.

**1)** Install jspm on your local machine if it isn’t already. It’s an auto-configure systemjs tool:
`$ npm i -g jspm@beta`

**2)** Run in whatever dir pleases you:
`$ jspm init`

**3)** Select all the defaults given to you. Then run:
`$ jspm i npm:{package_you_want_to_install}`
For instance: `jspm i npm:data.task` This will give a verbose working example of the config file needed to achieve in-browser compiling.

**4)** After init is done, this is the barebones .html page you will need:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QfBRAe4xp95hUC9bSIhOaSanvInun0erAoUtjBQTdZ9AldfSC_-aOj-2nv1gbCf28B3MXmQK46WI0ABJCBbP8FBwjY2F-c8nmWOr79KsqIWWw5QaD2TsX4-nWEbXUGBEeJGZd1aE)

**5)** You then need to create an `app.js` file in the `src` directory `src/app.js` . This file will contain the code you want to run. Any packages that are installed using
`jspm i npm:{package_you_want_to_install}` will create a `jspm_packages/npm/{package_you_want_to_install}@1.2.3.json` file.

**6)** ⚡️ Copy those contents. ⚡️
The content will be placed in your `SystemJS.config` under the packages property as the package you installed. For instance:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8j8p214IkMmQBkcdc9Y8m4ctaHcRfZGMksRnYHJ3IOa0y0okvb6TE0gVjZu-8a0qL_S_XRFnayxS1ID9yEh_EYuIbum_Arlwriy9sFeIaCLiausO2wqcFmUwFnFPeLLo9V5_Y4T9)

**7)** Jspm will also give you a `jspm.config.js` file: Copy this file, with some slight modifications.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Vyby8a90s6HEJspKmtAsyx6rzK_G0t1lUUtehzkc_3S-7e6QealWhI-yuSpP8IAf65BGyGOTG73BbStHeuna8SI9OmRU6xjZnEcbfqdK6xhUpiZ4AK_3gVRdRFe0AqNk32fFGDsn)

Note that the `"baseURL":` property was changed from `/` to a `.`

Also note that
`"systemjs-babel-build": "npm:systemjs-plugin-babel/systemjs-babel-browser.js` **line was added under the** `map` property (nested in the `devConfig` property).

**8)** For Plunker apps, just add this script tag (in `index.html` ): `<scriptsrc="https://unpkg.com/systemjs@0.19.41/dist/system.src.js"></script>`

**9)** Then the two `SystemJS.config` objects can be added in their own script. Now you’re good to go!

Here’s [one last example of a Plunker embed](http://embed.plnkr.co/UxkIoIK9PEkaupwTInDE?show=script.js,preview) to send you on your way.

# Host a demo REST API

Want data to play around with in your next egghead lesson?

egghead co-founder and instructor extraordinaire John Lindquist set us up with a REST API using [swapi](https://swapi.co/) (The Star Wars API) and [json-server](https://github.com/johnlindquist/swapi-json-server). As long as you don’t openly endorse or promote swapi (or Star Wars), you’ll have no issues with copyrights.

If you don’t have a need for any special configurations, you can spin up the server using [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx).

npx ships with the latest versions of npm, so you probably already have it installed.

`$ npx https://github.com/johnlindquist/swapi-json-server`
`// --> http://localhost:3000`

💥 Presto. You’re now running a REST API using Star Wars data. 💥

### Build custom data for egghead lessons

Of course, you have endless options for building a REST API.

If your data needs to be unique for the lesson you’re crafting (there’s a lesson for that!)

John shows us how to generate a large dataset of JSON data:

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-creating-demo-apis-with-json-server/embed" />

### 100 random people

If 100 random people is enough for your data set, grab this gist: [100 people in JSON format](https://gist.github.com/johnlindquist/3a7d28dbf231c476d62dd3f481d7b1c5).

### Serve JSON locally

`json-server` will serve any JSON file we have ready.

`$ npm i -g json-server`

`$ json-server {data.json}`

You're good to go.

### Host a REST API

Zeit's [now](https://zeit.co/now) feature is a great way to host any application needing it.

You can use the now command with an app John set up:

`$ npm i -g now`
`$ now https://github.com/johnlindquist/swapi-json-server`

If this is your first time using now, there will be a small amount of setup, but overall it's a breeze.

There’s a lesson for that, too. Check out [Deploy Web Apps with Zeit Now](https://egghead.io/courses/deploy-web-apps-with-zeit-now) for an in-depth look at `now`. Watch it right now!
