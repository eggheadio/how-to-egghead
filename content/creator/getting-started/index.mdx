So you've been invited to create badass screencasts on egghead?

Now what.

First and foremost, welcome to egghead. We are very happy to have you and look forward to getting to know you better.

We like to start small and increment. 

## Record a screencast just 30 seconds long

The first step is to start the feedback and collaboration loop with your egghead coaches. We want to get you going as quickly as possible, with the least amount of frustration.

We can't say it too many times: **screencasting is a difficult skill to pick up**.

Which is why we spend so much time and effort collaborating with you directly.

You've got an entire team at your disposal with thousands of hours of recorded screencasts under our belts.

We will help you create high-quality best in class screencast lessons, and to start we just want to see a video that is about 30-seconds long, give or take a few seconds...

Ready to get started? [Click here to read more about the 30-second demo lesson.](/creator/getting-started/30-second-demo)

Once you've recorded your demo lesson, you're ready to share it for feedback.

## Share your 30sec Demo Lesson with your egghead coaches

Now that you've got 

## Feedback on Your Work: What to Expect

Think of your 30-second video as a very rough draft. It won’t be perfect—and it shouldn’t be! It’s a gut check to see how we can help steer you toward egghead style.

You want to dial in your:

- basic instruction style
- code example
- screen dimensions
- font sizes

### Questions? Just #ask.

We’re here to help you. Before you record your video, use your private Slack channel to fire over any questions or works in progress, like:

- [**Lesson ideas**](/what-should-you-teach)**.** We can help you brainstorm or fine-tune an idea you have. (Chances are, we’ll suggest you scale back the scope of your example. Your lesson should cover one topic and one topic only. No more, no less.)
- [**Your lesson title and summary**](/write-the-title-and-summary). These should be concise and hyper-focused. Before you write any code, make sure you’ve chiseled your lesson idea until it’s simple and able to be tackled in a short video.
- [**A draft of your code example**](/create-your-code-example). Share it over screen sharing technology with your coach on Slack. Walk them through the steps it took to create the example, and think through any changes your coach suggests.

We’re all about supportive, ongoing feedback at egghead, so when you’re ready to press record, you’re _really_ ready.

### Feedback

Before you upload your video to your slack channel (if we’ve invited you to be an instructor), ask yourself:

- Is my screen set to 1280x720 (720p)? (In HiDPI, if possible?)
- Is my code example easy to understand?
- Did I guide the viewer’s eyes with the mouse?
- Did I use those 30 seconds to share useful insights?

We’ll use those questions to guide our feedback, which we’ll share with you over Slack.

After that, we may go through a few rounds of rerecording and feedback until we feel you’re ready to go off and record your first lesson.

Remember: We want you to succeed. We want you to absolutely crush it. Feedback—especially right when you start with egghead—will help you get there.

## We Send You Pro Audio Equipment

You’ll get:

- K & M 23150-500-55 Tabletop Microphone Stand with 5/8" Threaded Connector and Mini Boom Arm

Our [technical guide](/set-up-your-audio) covers setup and how each item works.

## You will be paid for your content.

Yes! egghead instructors make money! You receive royalties for all the views your lessons and courses get.

How much you get paid can range from "lunch money" to "paying the bills!", and primarily varies with the quality and quantity of what you publish. [Courses](/course-production) take the most effort, but they also make the most money. Even a single lesson can net you rewarding royalties for a long time; with a keyword-rich summary and title, a lesson can surface in search engine results years after it’s published.

$$ BREAK TO DO THE MONEY DANCE $$

The best way to make money is to produce interesting, useful content. Quantity is good, but quality is better. Good content sells itself.

We don't produce sponsored content or run ads on a regular basis. It’s all about eyeballs. 👀

### How royalties work

Royalties are paid at the beginning of the month, and reflect how many 30-second segments viewers watched in the previous month. We use PayPal or direct deposit to distribute royalties.

The amount you’re paid depends on the overall gross subscription revenue, and how many 30-second segments were watched in total. We use this basic algorithm in Ruby:

```ruby
egghead_monthly_revenue  * ( your_segments / total_segments ) * royalty_percent
```

![royalty_crown](./images/ch1_s2_royaltycrown.png)

Royalties are pooled, so the more egghead members that watch your lessons, the more your monthly royalty check will be. This means that having a catalog of many useful lessons is the best way to increase your roaylty checks!

We only send a check if your monhtly royalties are above $100, otherwise we will keep track and send you a check when they reach $100.

### Keeping it up

Many people create a lesson or two, then stop.

It can be frustrating. It **is** frustrating, particularly if you haven't done a lot of screencasting in the past.

It can take several hours to create a two minute lesson.

The trick is to keep going. The worst part is past and you're on your way to screencasting like a pro.

That said, there are a variety of reasons people stop making lessons:

- Way too freaking busy!
- It's hard AF.
- I can't think of what to record.

We can't help you with your busy schedule. ;)

It's too be expected though, because that's the type of folks we work with. Smart profressionals are **always** busy. Creating egghead lessons is an aspect of your career, and in our experience can be treated as such. That means you have to make time to create egghead content, as it is impossible to find the time.

And creating screencasts **is hard af**. For everybody. Particularly when you just start. Read the guide. Watch this video series. Scroll through this list of expert level time saving tips.

We're here to help. If you're feeling stuck, send your coaches an email, message us in Slack, or schedule a time to chat on Zoom.

But, if you need a break that's fine too. We will check in on occasion with encouragement and ideas.
