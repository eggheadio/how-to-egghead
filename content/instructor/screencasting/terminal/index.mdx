If you will be showing your command line, we suggest using a minimal prompt to reduce distractions. This example prompt works well for screencasting:

You can use this one by updating your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` with the following:

```bash
export PS1="\n\[\e[32m\]\W\n\[\e[m\]\[\e[34m\]\\$\[\e[m\]"
```

Note: If youâ€™re on Mac and using Bash, you also need to add a `~/.bash_profile` with this:

`source $HOME/.bashrc`

This tells Mac to load your `~/.bashrc` when loading a terminal emulator.

## Customize the Command Prompt in VS Code

/>

Use custom `ENV` variables if you prefer to only customize the PS1 Bash/Zsh command prompt in the VS Code terminal without affecting your other custom terminal themes in other applications, such as iTerm2.

In VS Code, add a new property, `terminal.integrated.env.osx`, and a new variable that will run a value.

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.env.osx": {
    "VSC": "yes lol!"
  }
}
```

Open zsh resource file, `~/.zshrc` and add a simple check at the end of the file to handle the case when the terminal is open in VS Code. Save and reload everything.

```shell
if [ "$VSC" = "yes lol!"], then
  PS1='\$ '
fi
```

This works in Bash with `~/.bashrc` as well.

Now, the command prompt is now a `$` sign in VS Code's terminal while keeping other custom terminal themes intact.
