Playing around with code is critical to becoming a better web developer.

For every egghead lesson, we provide a concise, organized, readable code example below the lesson video in a runnable embed, using CodeSandbox or a similar service. That way, egghead members can jump in right away.

Note: You should always record in your preferred environment using your favorite text editor, and then repurpose your code using CodeSandbox or your service of choice. 

You do you!
