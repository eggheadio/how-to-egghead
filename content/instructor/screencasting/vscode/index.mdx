If you are using VSCode, egghead instructor [Andy Van Slaars](https://twitter.com/avanslaars) has put together a [GitHub repo with a screencasting profile](https://github.com/avanslaars/code-profiles) that loads the settings he uses when recording screencasts.

Here are some more settings that help remove some of the distractions:

```
"editor.minimap.enabled": false,
"explorer.confirmDragAndDrop": false,
"editor.fontSize": 18,
"terminal.integrated.fontSize": 18,
"workbench.activityBar.visible": false,
"editor.quickSuggestions": false,
"editor.suggestOnTriggerCharacters": false,
"editor.wordBasedSuggestions": false,
"editor.quickSuggestionsDelay": 1000000,
"editor.parameterHints.enabled": false
```
