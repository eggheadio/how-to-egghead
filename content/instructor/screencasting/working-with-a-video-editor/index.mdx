If you choose to have our video editor help with the final versions of your course, here are some tips on how to best utilize their help:


## Recording Your Audio

As you record, keep this in mind:

Your video editor is listening!

Provide verbal instructions for your video editor to follow. It’s perfectly fine to say “VIDEO EDITOR, Let’s start that over again at…”

If you misspeak when recording, take a second and provide a verbal cue to the editor. 

When correcting yourself after mis-speaking, it will help the editing process if you start the sentence over. If you try to pick up where you misspoke, it might end up sounding awkward if shoehorned together.

It might go without saying, but trying to minimize external noise will go a long way toward the final product.

Long periods of silence are easy to take care of!

You also have the option to overdub audio later if something doesn’t sound quite right. You can add a word of phrase instead of several sentences.


## Recording Your Screen

In addition to listening for instructions, your editor will follow along with your mouse movements as an “audience member”. 

In many cases, freeze frames can be used to mask some imperfections if needed. 



## Exporting Files

Video files should be exported to 2560x1440 MPEG 4 at 30FPS.

When saving your raw lesson recordings, name them with sequential numbers and a slug for your course:

    `01_COURSENAME_LESSONNAME.mp4`

Following consistent naming will help keep your project organized!

egghead provides a Dropbox folder for transferring the raw recordings to the editor. When the time comes, we can share this information with you.


## Reviewing the Final Product

When the editor is done editing, it’s best to review their work. This way you can ensure that everything is presented the way that it should be with no accidental keystroke cuts, etc.
