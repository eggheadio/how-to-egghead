While creating your lesson and recording your video are extremely vital steps to creating the best lesson you could publish, so is the editing of the lesson.

At egghead, we recommend using Camtasia (Windows/Mac) or Screenflow (Mac) for recording and editing. However, whatever software you want to use, we can probably get a license for you - Just #ask in Slack!

When recording lessons, you should record “one thought at a time.” Your editing-self will thank you! Between each 20 second “paragraph,” take a pause so that it will be easy for you to visually see where you need to ripple delete when the time comes!

# Editing with Ripple Delete

This instructor feedback cycle turned into ["Reduce Boilerplate with yargs middleware in a Node.js Command Line Tool"](https://egghead.io/lessons/node-js-reduce-boilerplate-with-yargs-middleware-in-a-node-js-command-line-tool) by [Khaled Garbaya](https://egghead.io/instructors/khaled-garbaya).

The instructor does a great job highlighting the parts of the code he is working on as he talks about them so that you can immediately see what he is teaching about. The lesson length is definitely on the longer side, being almost 6 minutes long. There are probably ways to cut down the time. There seems to also be an editing error at the end where the track repeats for a few seconds.

Let's see what the official feedback says!

## First Take - Written Feedback

`01:56`-`02:42`- this can be cut in favor of how you paste in another command at`04:37`- since it’s essentially the same code as before, it’s ok to save time here and not show you swapping the code out

`04:37`-`END`- worth noting the Kent’s last name is spelled with two ’d’s so Kent C. Dodds

`05:31`-`05:33`- editing hiccup, you repeat yourself here

## Second Take

The lesson length has been cut in half! The lesson flows much quicker with the instructor's editing. Learning the same content, but much more efficiently.
