We discussed avoiding intros a little bit in the previous instructor feedback cycle example, but here’s another example to drive the message through. 

Intros and outros belong in the accompanying description, tilt,e course page, etc., and not within the lesson itself. The lesson should get right to the point, and teach a skill.

This lesson ended up as [“Create a gradient with a Sass loop”](https://egghead.io/lessons/scss-create-a-gradient-with-a-sass-loop) by Tomasz Lakomy.

## First Take Feedback

The only note I have is at 01:20-END, this is a bit of an outro and can be cut.

Another great way to show the output instead is to inspect the element and see exactly what is being applied to each div in the browser.

And… It looks great! There’s not much left to say! It takes you from “one state” to the “completed state” in 1 and a half minutes utilizing the "egghead style"! There is no "intro" and no "outro," so the learner is diving straight into the topic at hand, and learning a skill.
