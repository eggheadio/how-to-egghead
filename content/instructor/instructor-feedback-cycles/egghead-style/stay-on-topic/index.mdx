## First Take - Written Feedback

`START`-`00:34`- This is initial set up that you can mention in the description that will also be apparent in the code example so can be cut. It’s alright to assume some knowledge (in this case npm) so **you don’t have to start from scratch every lesson.**

`03:18`- When you run the query, it would be great to **review the flow of how graphQL is handling the query with what we just wrote.** 

As an example for you, John does [a great job of it here](https://egghead.io/lessons/vue-js-catch-errors-when-data-fails-to-load-with-vue-js-and-rxjs#t=70) (`01:14`-`END` of the lesson)
