At egghead, we show our work (“show, don’t tell”), we like to speak concisely, and record one thought at a time.

To see how aligned to the "egghead style" your lessons are, we recommend that you watch your video on mute and see if there are any prolonged pauses where “nothing” is happening. If there is “nothing” happening on screen for more than 5 seconds, it may be an indication that you’re going off topic. Try to “show” what you are doing as you speak so that your learners can remain engaged in the learning process.

## Key Takeaways and Resources

We like to show our work, speak concisely, record one thought at a time, avoid intros/outros, and stay on topic. Here are some resources that could help you learn more about how to create the “egghead Style”!
