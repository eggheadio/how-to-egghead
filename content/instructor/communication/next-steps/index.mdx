Taking the first step is the hardest, but now you are on your way. Congrats on publishing your first lesson! We highly recommend jumping right into your next lesson as soon as possible to keep the momentum going.

From now on feel free to [upload your new lesson videos directly to egghead](https://egghead.io/lessons/new).

When you've uploaded a new lesson, let your coaches know in your Slack channel or send an email. Whatever works best for you.

If you're struggling to find something to teach, we can help you! You are not alone, and we are happy to help.

You'll notice each lesson will get a little easier to record and publishing will come a little faster.
 
Thats progress. ðŸ™Œ

After 12 published lessons, you'll have the ability to self approve/publish your own lessons. We'll always be here for you if you'd like a review on a particular difficult lesson but at this point, we trust your judgement on producting lessons.
