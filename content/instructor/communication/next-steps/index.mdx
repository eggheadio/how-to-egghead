Taking the first step is the hardest, but now you are on your way. Congrats on publishing your first lesson! We highly recommend jumping right into your next lesson as soon as possible to keep the momentum going.

From now on feel free to [upload your new lesson videos directly to egghead](https://egghead.io/lessons/new).

When you've uploaded a new lesson, let your coaches know in your Slack channel or send an email. Whatever works best for you.

If you're struggling to find something to teach, we can help you! You are not alone, and we are happy to help.

Creating screencasts is a learned skill that requires practice. With each lesson you create, you should notice that it gets a little easier. If you're feeling stuck or frustrated, your coaches will help. This is hard to do, especially when you are just getting started and you have access to all the support we can offer.
 
We are here to help you shine. ðŸ™Œ

After 12 published lessons, you'll have the ability to self approve/publish your own lessons. We'll always be here for you if you'd like a review on a particular difficult lesson but at this point, we trust your judgement on producting lessons.
