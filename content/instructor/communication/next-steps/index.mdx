The first 30-second demo started with you uploading a clip to slack. Those days are past us now. Feel free to upload directly to egghead (to your hearts desire!) for the following lessons.

The process will largely be the same as the first lesson you produced. When you upload a lesson, you can link to it in your personal instructor chat and it will be reviewed and iterated on with a coach.

You'll notice each lesson will get a little easier to record and publishing will come a little faster.
 
Thats progress. ðŸ™Œ

After 12 published lessons, you'll have the ability to self approve/publish your own lessons. We'll always be here for you if you'd like a review on a particular difficult lesson but at this point, we trust your judgement on producting lessons.
