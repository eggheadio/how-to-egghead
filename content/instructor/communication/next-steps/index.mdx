Taking the first step is the hardest, but now you are on your way. Congrats on publishing your first lesson! We highly recommend jumping right into your next lesson as soon as possible to keep the momentum going.

The process will largely be the same as the first lesson you produced. When you upload a lesson, you can link to it in your personal instructor chat and it will be reviewed and iterated on with a coach.

You'll notice each lesson will get a little easier to record and publishing will come a little faster.
 
Thats progress. ðŸ™Œ

After 12 published lessons, you'll have the ability to self approve/publish your own lessons. We'll always be here for you if you'd like a review on a particular difficult lesson but at this point, we trust your judgement on producting lessons.
