Welcome to the egghead instructor guide. This is a reference for egghead instructors to help them plan and execute screencasts to be published on egghead.io and elsewhere.

We've put together [several instructor case studies](/instructor/case-studies/) if you'd like to meet a few instructors and hear more about their stories.

Here are some quick links to articles of interest:

egghead is an invite only platform. This guide assumes you've been invited and are an active egghead instructor. If that's not the case, please feel free to use this guide as a resource for creating badass screencasts on your own. We believe that [nobody needs permission](/instructor/getting-started/get-invited) to share what they know and teach others online.

## Screencasting is hard.

There is a lot of work that goes into creating high-quality learning materials.

Screencasting takes considerable effort. It's a learned skill that is particularly difficult if you are just learning how to do it.

Recording yourself coding while explaining it is a completely different skill tree than programming computers. Often this surprises to folks when they first dip their toes into creating egghead lessons.

We are here to help! You aren't alone.

As an egghead instructor you will receive coaching and world-class support to help you go from newbie to badass as quickly as possible.

We've helped over 150 developers create and publish over 4000 screencast lessons. 😳

## Why be an instructor?

Teaching others and sharing knowledge is good for your own career.

If you're working for companies or working for yourself, your proven ability to share knowledge is a skill that you will be able to tap for the rest of your life.

As a published egghead instructor, you will be able to demonstrate both your ability to communicate as well as your knowledge and understanding of what it is you are teaching.

egghead instructors time and time again have benefited with new opportunities in their professional careers including conference talks, consulting gigs, and positions at the best companies.

We are here to help you create badass content that shows the world your knowledge and expertise, while helping other developers learn the skills and concepts they need to level up their own careers.

Tyler McGinninis and Kent C. Dodds have both gone from publishing workshops on egghead to launching their own products and projects independently.

At every step of the way we've been there to help and encourage them as much as possible.
