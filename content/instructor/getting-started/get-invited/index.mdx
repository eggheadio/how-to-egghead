We would love to be able to work with everybody and take the time and care that is required to craft world class educational materials with as many folks as possible.

Unfortunately we can't.

The good news? We've got some suggestions on how you can start building the skills needed to get invited as an egghead instructor and generally improve your own career generally in the process.

**You don't need our permission to create screencasts**. 

This is important to understand. egghead is a platform. We curate learning content for professional web developers. egghead is a small team focused on quality learning materials.

**You don't need us.**

You can start today. You can use [this guide](/instructor) to understand some of what goes into making screencasts for egghead and just freaking do it.

Please share what you make with us and the rest of the world, and keep it up.

That's how you get noticed. Doing and creating. 

Teaching everything you know. ❤️

It can be challenging and intimidating to learn in public, particularly if you are just starting out. 

Writing is a skill. 

Presenting screencasts is a skill. 

Hosting a live stream is a skill.

It takes consistent focused practice to get good at these skills, just like web development itself. The good news is that they are related and make powerful levers for your career and personal growth.

They can all be practiced in parallel with your continued growth as a professional developer and showcase your ability to communicate effectively and a willingness to share with others that ultimately has the potential to set you apart from others that aren't willing to put in the same level of effort.

## Write about what you are learning right now

Keep a learning journal! Post publically, preferrably on your own domain, but [dev.to](https://dev.to/) is fantastic too.

You don't have to post 5000 word technical tutorials. 

Keep it simple and informative. Provide context and links. Write for yourself. Pick a friend or collegue and write for them. It's often easier to "just f'n do it" if you have a specific individual you are writing for. 

Give it a try!

Practice sharing what you know and what you learn. It's a habit. A skill.

Share what you write on Twitter and ask [@jhooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks) (DMs are open).

## Creating Screencasts

We maintain an [egghead instructor guide](/instructor) that details our process for creating content at egghead. 

In the guide, we talk about the technical and content development aspects for producing high quality screencasts for web developers. You can safely ignore the fancy equipment we recommend. We have to have consistent audio quality across thousands of screencasts so the gear is meant to help insure that for our paying members.

We think [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) is fantastic on the Mac and [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is great for Windows.

Follow the guide. Share what you know. Post it on twitter. Share it with [@jhooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks).

## Start live streaming your learning.

Live streaming is incredibly powerful and rewarding

Live streaming is also intimdating to get started!

Some of the technical details are related to screencasting with some significant differences.

[This guide from Suz Hinton](https://medium.com/@suzhinton/my-twitch-live-coding-setup-b2516672fb21) is great. 

Chris Biscardi has also started a community for folks that are creating live stream content:

<div style={{ marginTop: '45px', marginBottom: '45px' }}>
  <TwitterTweetEmbed
    tweetId={'1200987098620157953'}
    options={{ align: 'center' }}
  />
</div>

## What else?

These are difficult skills to master, but worth the effort to hone. They are super powers. [Learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) benefits your career and paves the way for others. It's a way to actively participate in a community you help to build.
