egghead instructors are invited to teach. We are a small team with a focus on quality and not quantity. This means that we are consistently rejecting folks that ask to be instructors on egghead.

We would love to be able to work with everybody and take the time and care that is required to craft world class educational materials with as many folks as possible.

Unfortunately we can't.

The good news?

**You don't need our permission to create screencasts**. You can start today. You can use this guide to understand some of what goes into making screencasts for egghead and just freaking do it.

Please share what you make with us and the rest of the world, and keep it up.

That's how you get noticed. Doing and creating. Teaching everything you know. ❤️
