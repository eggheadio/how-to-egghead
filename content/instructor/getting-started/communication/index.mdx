We use several communication channels, and are happy to accommodate preferences. They are:

- email: planning and feedback
- Slack: our instructor community
- Zoom: real-time planning, feedback, and workshop events

## Email

If you're an egghead instructor, we've likely communicated via email already. We use and enjoy email as a primary form of asynchronous conversation. For the most part it has an adequate response time, thankfully "egghead emergencies" are not a thing.

## Zoom

For real-time collaboration, we use Zoom. The ability to share a screen and use video makes the entire process so much smoother. These are scheduled in advance with your coaching team.

We also use Zoom for live workshop events.

## Slack

We also use Slack. Traditionally this was the primary communication channel for egghead instructors, and it is still a great place to chat and enjoy conversation with your egghead coaches as well as the egghead instructor community.

### Joining Slack

Once you’ve [signed up](http://egghead.io/) for egghead and created your instructor profile, you’ll receive an invitation to our Slack channel. That’s where you can meet other instructors from all over the world, talk shop, and get all the support you need from your egghead team.

Bring your best emoji game.

When you join Slack, we’ll create a private instructor channel just for you. That’s where we’ll share feedback with you, hash out lesson ideas, and answer any questions you have.

### Your private instructor channel

Right when you get started on egghead, we’ll set up a private channel for you. Here, you can work with your coach and other top-tier instructors to nail egghead style and get your first lesson published. Feel free to ask any questions, brainstorm ideas for your first lessons and workshops, and share drafts. We’re here to help.

### #egghead-chat

This is the "water cooler" channel, where basically anything goes (within the general code of conduct, of course). Many egghead instructors are freelancers or work at home, so this gives us a place to socialize and talk about programming and industry stuff. It is noisy, so you might be compelled to mute this channel, but it’s always here when you need it.

### #instructor-support

Creating bite-sized code videos is an art form. This is where we discuss it. This channel is a great place to solicit feedback from other instructors and the wider egghead team about your latest lesson ideas, workshop proposals, and drafts. We've got an amazing group of experienced instructors who are happy to help you. It’s a great community, and you should lean on it whenever you need to.

### #egghead-publishing-queue

This is where egghead’s publishing activity is announced by bots. When a lesson is uploaded, or a workshop/lesson is published, it’s automatically announced in this channel. Keep an eye on it from time to time to see what’s coming down the pike.

### Etcetera

We've got other channels for specific topics like music & tv, fitness, functional programming, and podcasts. Surprise surprise, egghead instructors are passionate people.

Like most Slack groups, members are welcome to make public and private channels, DM with anyone, litter every channel with emoji and gifs, and even add integrations. Use your good judgment, and if you have any questions, please feel free to #ask.
