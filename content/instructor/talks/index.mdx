This is the **call for proposals** for egghead's ongoing live virtual conference. This document provides details on what that is and how you can participate.

Do you have a talk you've given (or want to give) and would like to deliver it to a live audience without the hassle, expense, and potential hazard that travel causes?

Would you like to earn royalties for the recording of your talk without dealing with ads or paywalls?

We can help!

The egghead community wants to learn from you, and to help connect you egghead will be running an ongoing, online, virtual conference. We are looking for great talks that help web developers level up, learn, and get exposure to new ideas, techniques and tactics.

## Interesting for Web Developers

We want to present talks that are first and foremost **interesting for web developers**

* Stories about how you built products or experiences
* Stories about overcoming challenges as a developer
* Ideas for solving problems that exist today
* Are you pushing the limits of the web?
* Can we all be doing something better?

Your talk can be directly about web development, but if it is _interesting_ we'd love to see it as well.

* Alternative programming models
* The history of component based models
* Philosophy of computing
* Something totally different!

These could all be a great fit if you convince us that it is interesting for web developers!

We want speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds because:

### Web development is for people of all experience levels and backgrounds

egghead talks are targeting 15 and 30 minutes, but can be longer if you've got a compelling topic.

We won't have a live Q&A session but we will gather questions from the audience, curate them, and present you with a selection of them to answer if you care to and we will follow up with attendees and future viewers.



You can submit as many proposals as you like. We look at **every proposal** and will provide feedback when yours is reviewed!

## How talk selection works

We review all proposals and make every effort to respond to them within three weeks. 

Because this is an **ongoing online virtual conference** we aren't strictly bound to a short timeline. A proposal submitted today might be scheduled near or far in the future.

### When reading talk proposals the team will consider the following:

- **Relevance**: Is this topic interesting to an audience of web developers?
- **Novelty and Originality**: Does the talk provide the audience with new information? Preference will be given to presentations not previously available to a wide audience.
- **Storytelling and Organisation**: Is the proposal well organised? Will the audience tune into the narrative? Will the speaker use their time effectively? Will the speaker’s story connect with the audience?
- **Bottom Line**: What’s the takeaway of your talk? How will the presentation improve attendees’ knowledge, outlook, and inspiration?

## Writing a Good Proposal

A good proposal does two things: shows you have a story the attendees will want to hear, and shows that you can present this story in an engaging and exciting fashion. 

We ask for three pieces of information.

### The first thing we want is the abstract. 

The abstract is the pitch to the attendees. It will appear on the schedule along with the title, and should tell attendees what they will learn from your talk and why they care about it. You don't have to give away all your secrets, but you should at least describe the thesis of your talk. The abstract is limited to 600 characters, so make those words count.

### The second thing we want is the details of your talk. 

This is more detailed information about how your talk will go down. Do you have an outline? What is the structure of your talk? How will you start? What is your conclusion? If you have live demos, how will you make sure they don't crash and burn? This information won't be made public. Also, if you don't know all of this when you propose, that is ok. Just give as much detail as you have.

### The last thing we want is the pitch. 

This is where you pitch yourself as the the person capable of making this talk awesome. Why does this talk need to happen? Why are you excited about it? Why are you the right person to give it? If you have prior speaking experience, links to other talks you've done are great here. If you are a brand new speaker, help us know how you'll perform on stage.

## Speaker Benefits

All talks will be recorded, lightly edited, and presented on egghead.io **free to view for all** in our catalog.

All speakers will receive a $100 honorarium.

All speakers will [**receive royalties**](/instructor/royalties) from views of their talks on egghead.io.

All speakers will be given a lifetime Pro membership to egghead.

All speakers will get an egghead t-shirt

## Scheduling

Your talk will be scheduled based on your availability. We typically operate on Pacific time at egghead, but can coordinate to meet the needs of our global membership. 

## Venue

We use [Zoom webinars](https://zoom.us/webinar) and can host thousands of attendees from across the globe.

Webinars allow control of the "panel" and allow a select few folks to present while allowing many thousands to view.

## Presentation

Zoom's webinar allows you to cleanly present to thousands of people. We use screen sharing from your computer to present your slides and your web camera to give the audience a more personal feel with your face alongside the slides being presented.

Using a headset and microphone gives the best results and a stable internet connection is required for presenting.

Technical issues can arise, and when they do we do the best we can to accomodate and are always happy to reschedule as convenient.

## Accessibility

Live closed-captioning is not provided at this time however the free recordings will be available within 1 week and will include transcripts and subtitles.

We will continue to evaluate live closed-captioning and will accomodate all audience members to the best of our abilities to meet any special requests.

## Code of Conduct

We take our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct) very seriously and will not tolerate any violations of it from our presenters, staff, or attendees.

Period.
