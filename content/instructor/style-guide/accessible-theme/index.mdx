Using a high contrast and colorblind friendly theme is important because we want your video to be visible to as many people as possible. 

That's why we recommend Sarah Drasner's [Night Owl Light theme for VSCode.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) Both the dark and light themes are colorblind friendly but we recommend the light theme for higher visiblity!
