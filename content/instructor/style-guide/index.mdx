At egghead we've got strong opinions about how screencast tutorials should be created and presented. We also firmly believe that there is room for experiments and even _truly_ off-norm presentations.

If you haven't seen [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) please give it a watch and then come back.

We love to hear your ideas, even your far out ideas, for the most part we want clean, concise, information dense screencasts that are tailored for busy folks that wnat to fit learning into a hectic schedule.

To that end, we've put together a few guides:

- [What makes a great lesson?](/instructor/style-guide/great-lessons)
- [Thinking in lessons](/instructor/style-guide/thinking-in-lessons)
- [What should you teach?](/instructor/style-guide/what-to-teach)
- [What if a topic already exists?](/instructor/style-guide/lesson-already-exists)
- [Creating the Code Example](/instructor/style-guide/create-the-example-code)
- [Talking about code for understanding.](/instructor/style-guide/talking-about-code)
- [Publishing Your Lesson](/instructor/style-guide/publishing-your-lesson)
