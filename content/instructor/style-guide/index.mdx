At egghead we've got strong opinions about how screencast tutorials should be created and presented. We also firmly believe that there is room for experiments and even _truly_ off-norm presentations.

If you haven't seen [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) please give it a watch and then come back.

While we love to hear your ideas, even your far out ideas, for the most part we want clean, concise, information dense screencasts that are tailored for busy folks that wnat to fit learning into a hectic schedule.

To that end, we've put together a few guidelines.

# What makes a great lesson?

Imagine calling a coworker over to your desk to show them something cool you just learned. Would you make a slide deck? Use star-dissolve transitions? Nah, you’d just dive right in.

That’s what egghead learners want you to do. They’re looking for concise, efficient information that respects their time and shows them how to do something. Nothing fancy, just badass.

In the spirit of show, don’t tell, this free course by egghead cofounder John Lindquist shows what makes a great lesson: [Record Badass Screencasts for egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/record-badass-screencasts-for-egghead-io)

### It’s focused

An egghead lesson discusses a single topic. Don’t stray—stay on point and be concise.

Learners should walk away with a better understanding of the concept covered in the lesson. In just a few minutes, they should increase their vocabulary and learn through a high-quality example.

John Lindquist - Stay on topic:

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-stay-on-topic/embed" />

### Its title and summary are precise

Writing concise titles and summaries is the best way to narrow the scope of your lesson so it’s hyper-focused on a single topic. (They’re also the best way to cash—and we mean cash—in on search terms. Mentioning relevant technologies = SEO = 💰)

Your summary should quickly tell learners what they’ll gain from your lesson. You could start by writing, “In this lesson, you will learn to...” One or two sentences are 👌

Your title is the summary of your summary. It should finish the thought, “How do I...”

[More on writing titles and summaries](/write-the-title-and-summary)

### The code example is simple and effective

[The code example](/create-your-code-example) is arguably the most important part of a lesson. The learner should be able to look at the difference between the _before_ and _after_ code to understand how you’ve applied the concept in the lesson.

If your example is airtight, it will do the instructing for you. Your narration will just serve to support it. Use the [“show your work” trick](/the-show-your-work-trick) to see if you’ve shown enough.

John Lindquist - Show then maybe explain:

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-show-first-then-maybe-explain/embed" />

### It cuts intros, outros, and stage-setting

**No** “hi, my name is.” **No** “in the previous lesson we learned about...” Each lesson should exist on its own without any stage-setting—just like this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT_OJZCYncA&

This video doesn't talk about the chicken recipe it covered for the dinner course. It doesn’t explain why you may need a cheesecake-stuffed cookie cake. (Attending a party? Stress-baking?) It doesn’t explain what sugar, cookie dough, and ovens are for the .00001% of the population that don’t already know. It just jumps right in.

When creating your lessons, assume your viewers have working knowledge of the topics covered or will pause the video to learn on their own time. Don’t waste time in your lesson reinventing the wheel (or explaining what wheels are and why they’re helpful).

John Lindquist - Avoid intros and outros:

<ResponsiveEmbed src="https://egghead.io/lessons/tools-avoid-intros-and-outros/embed" />

### It guides the eyes

Your audience is trying to follow what you're saying. It's crucial that you keep them with you by guiding their eyes.

Highlight the area of the screen you're teaching. Use the mouse to select/click/drag or anything that creates a sense of movement to tell them "You should be looking here!" Remember, this is a video, they're here for the movement, so keep it movin'!

### Slack us!

Still foggy on egghead style? Your coach (and the rest of us at egghead HQ) are here to clear the air. #ask!

# What should you teach?

_Quick! Come up with an idea!_ Unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way.

As with writing or drawing, instructing about _anything_ can be daunting. _Anything_ is too big a concept to wrap your head around. That’s why we need prompts.

Tell someone with writer’s block, “Describe your favorite food.” An hour later they’ll have an essay on cheeseburgers. Tell an artist, “Draw a cheeseburger,” and they’ll draw you a cheeseburger good enough to eat (and write about).

![cheeseburger](../../../images/illustrations/ch2_s2_cheeseburger.png)

The same goes for egghead lessons. Give yourself a prompt. Make it small and specific.

### Finding ideas

You’re surrounded by inspiring ideas for your next lesson. A few places to look:

![slack_icon](../../../images/illustrations/ch2_s2_icon-slack.png) **#egghead-lesson-ideas**. The egghead Slack is a great resource when you’re stuck. This channel was specifically created to help get you out of a creative jam. Hop in and see if anyone has ideas to spare—@joel usually comes through.

![os_icon](../../../images/illustrations/ch2_s2_icon-os.png) **Open-source projects**. If you work on an open-source project, contribute to one, or even just have a favorite open-source tool, you can often find great themes for a lesson in the work being done.

![trello_icon](../../../images/illustrations/ch2_s2_icon-trello.png)
**Trello cards and dev Slack channels**. What particular problems are other developers solving, and how? There’s a lesson.

![stackoverflow_icon](../../../images/illustrations/ch2_s2_icon-stacko.png)
**Stack Overflow**. This is a trove of pain from which to develop useful examples. A quick search reveals questions and answers that would make excellent lesson topics.

![]()
**Problems you’ve solved**. What web development challenge did you recently figure out? Tell learners how you did it.

![notes_icon](../../../images/illustrations/ch2_s2_icon-notes.png)
**Your own education**. Are you learning something cool right now? The best way to solidify what you learn is to teach it.

Plain old Googling is helpful, too. Type something like “Laravel how do I” and Google will autofill with popular search items. Lesson idea gold!

### Be super-specific

_How do I think of good lesson ideas?_

You just answered your own question. Use the phrase “How do I” to zero in on a specific topic to cover.

_“How do I...debug angular applications with Chrome DevTools”_

Or...

_“How do i...update ref attributes in React components”_

Two lessons ready to record!

But beware—this trick could lead to some overly ambitious ideas, like:

_“How do I build an app with Ruby”_

You’ll need a few days to cover that one. Think much smaller, and dive into a topic you can thoroughly cover in a few minutes, like:

_“How do I create a component with React on Rails?”_ That can be a lesson. In fact, it [_is_](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-creating-a-component-with-react-on-rails) [a lesson](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-creating-a-component-with-react-on-rails).

### Write it and code it

Think you have your lesson topic? Great! Now you need to stress test your topic to see if it’s focused enough.

_[Image: Something like detailing a car...showing very precise work.]_

Create these three supporting materials:

- [**Your lesson title**](/write-the-title-and-summary). Use that “How do I” trick. Does it work for your topic? Does your title cover one thing clearly—and can you cover that thing in a short amount of time? Then you’re good.
- [**Your lesson summary**](/write-the-title-and-summary). If it’s too long or requires a lot of detail to summarize, you might need to reduce the lesson’s scope.
- [**The code example**](/create-your-code-example) you’ll use to demonstrate the lesson concept. It should be easy to run with very few simple steps. If it requires several steps and screens—and if you anticipate needing to give a lot of background and contextual information to explain those steps—tighten your scope.

Think of these items as the outline you’d create before writing a school essay. If that outline gets too long and ambitious, you need to reel in the scope a bit.

### That lesson already exists? Do it anyway!

We have zero qualms about repeating topics. Actually, [we encourage it](/what-if-a-lesson-already-exists). No one knows exactly what you know or phrases things in your particular way. What’s your take? Tell us! Tell everybody.

### Slack us!

Truly stuck? #ask us for a jumpstart, or come up with some ideas and we’ll pare them down.

Remember: Think small. Don’t explain how to build the internet. Just a small corner of it.

# What if a lesson already exists?

Do you have a great lesson idea, but someone else got to it first? Make that lesson anyway.

> Boy, egghead.io sure has too many lessons on the fundamentals of React!

This was said by nobody, ever. We firmly believe that hard topics need the fundamentals covered by good examples. A lot of them. It helps people learn!

### Learning in layers

At egghead, we want to cover concepts in layers. We want to tuck our members in under cotton, wool, and down and help them fully and completely understand complex concepts one bite-sized lesson at a time.

Having one “expert” rule a concept only gives learners a one-sided, one-dimensional understanding of it. Imagine if only one songwriter in the history of music had written a love song, and all the other songwriters had said, “Oh, that concept has been covered before.” We’d be robbed of so many musical love stories, and the essential soundtrack to our own.

So what’s your take on the concept? It’s an essential layer. Add it to the mix.

### Diversity on both sides of learning

One of the things that makes egghead different from other learn-to-code services is how much we prioritize our instructors’ diversity. Our instructors live on six continents—Antarctica, you’re next!—and they all have different backgrounds, perspectives, and approaches to coding. That’s awesome!

Our instructors’ diversity also reflects the learners who watch our lessons. One instructor’s way of explaining a concept might not break through to someone, but another instructor’s might. It’s all about the code example you create, your unique turns of phrase, the you that _you_ bring to it.

### Beginners are experts, too!

Even if you’re relatively new to a concept, your perspective is important. There’s no replacing the beginner’s mindset—when concepts are new and exciting, when you see them with fresh eyes and clarity.

So even if someone more “experienced” has made a lesson about that concept, make your lesson anyway. Other beginners might learn better from you than the seasoned veteran.

# Write the title and summary

Naming things is hard. Naming things is vital.

Giving your lesson a solid title and summary _before you hit record_ helps you define the scope of your lesson. With strong titles and summaries, you also make your content more useful and meaningful to the thousands of developers who will watch it.

### Narrow your scope

There are thousands of lessons on egghead that learners find via site and Google search. The best way for them to find your lesson is with a robust, descriptive title.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/XIqCQx02E1U9W/giphy.gif)

Let's walk through the process of choosing your subject matter, then writing your title and summary.

### Start with an idea:

_“I've been working with React a lot lately. Something interesting about React components and their lifecycle methods that fire at particular times?"_

That’s a cool concept. You might quickly think of something like this for a title:

> React Component Lifecycle Methods

That’s a tempting title! But it's too broad for a bite-sized lesson. Let's narrow the topic down:

_"Reading about lifecycle methods in the React docs, I've noticed that_ `*componentWillReceiveProps*` _isn't as clear as some of the others."_

Now we have a target!

### Summarize the concept

Continuing to drill down on `componentWillReceiveProps`, we can write a quick summary of what the viewer can expect:

> In this lesson, you will learn to dynamically update a React component's state based on the properties that are passed into it. We will take a look at the React component componentWillReceiveProps lifecycle method, and how to use it effectively.

That’s a strong, succinct concept that you can reasonably cover in a few minutes. ✅

### Write your title (the summary of your summary)

Here's a trick to coming up with a good title: Think "How do I..." and then summarize your summary.

You wouldn't say "How do I... react component lifecycle methods: `componentWillReceiveProps.` ”

Instead, you would say something like "How do I... use `componentWillReceiveProps` to manage react component state?”

> Use componentWillReceiveProps to Manage React Component State

That’s a strong, specific title that tells learners what to expect from the lesson. People watch screencasts to solve specific problems and learn specific things, and good descriptions help them find the answers they’re looking for.

So our title and summary are:

> **Use componentWillReceiveProps to Manage React Component State**
> In this lesson, you will learn to dynamically update a React component's state based on the properties that are passed into it. We will take a look at the React component `componentWillReceiveProps` lifecycle method, and how to use it effectively.

✅✅

# Create your code example

The code example shows your concept in action. It’s the foundation of your lesson.

A good example is simple and focused on one ultra-specific concept. After watching your lesson, the learner will have access to the code in Plunker to play around with, so your example should be easy to run with in just a few simple steps without in-depth knowledge of a specific domain.

### What should your example look like?

Your code example will almost definitely have two different states: a start and a finish.

The _start_ state could either be:

- a blank screen, if you’re starting from scratch
- a structured shell that you add to

The _finished_ state will reflect the concept that you’ve just explained.

The difference between _start_ and _finish_ directly defines the scope and complexity of the lesson. If you can’t get to _finish_ in under 10 minutes or without using complex steps, you should probably [revisit your title and summary](/write-the-title-and-summary) and scale back a bit. Don’t try to boil the ocean!

### If there’s more you want to cover...

There’s always more to learn. Always. We can’t teach it all, and we especially can’t teach everything in a single lesson.

If you’re an experienced egghead instructor with a few published lessons and you want to keep expanding on your example, it might be time to [create a course](/course-production). With courses, one example is used as a connective thread throughout several lessons. Courses are a great challenge, and they often make you more money. 💰

### Your code embedded

Every egghead lesson page has a spot for the viewer to find the relevant code. Depending on the lesson’s context, the code may be linked to a GitHub repo/gist, or embedded from one of several popular “code playground” sites like Plunker and CodeSandbox.

![](./images/your-code-embedded.png)

Embedded examples let learners play around with your code to apply what they’ve just learned. It’s a good reminder: Though your lesson may feel like a performance, it exists to help other web developers learn. For more information, check out Sharing your code.

### Slack us!

Need help with Plunker or want a second pair of eyes on your example? Share it with your coach on Slack. They’ve seen hundreds of examples—some extraordinary, some ehh—so don’t be self-conscious about your coding skills. Your coach will kindly point out anything to fix or ways to tighten your scope.

# How to instruct

You’ve nailed your title, summary, and code example. Now it’s time to figure out what you’re going to say.

The “instructor” title can feel daunting. Don’t let it! If you’ve ever shown someone how to do something, you’re an experienced instructor.

### Speak to support the code

In your lesson, you should show first (with your code) then maybe explain (with your voice). Your narration is quite simply the explanation of the changes you’re making to your code as you take it from its _start_ state to its _finished_ state.

You won’t be asking questions that teachers typically do, like “What themes can we draw from this?” You will simply relay information, explain how and why you did what, and let the learners soak it in. **Keep it simple and focused on the code.**

### Write a script or outline

Your narration should sound casual but informed, like you’re showing something to a coworker. Some instructors find it helpful to **write out a script** beforehand so they’re never in doubt of what to say. It’s a great way to cut the “umm”s and “uhh”s and make your explanation as tight as possible.

If you’d rather sound more conversational, less scripted, **write out an outline**. We’re talking bullet points—the keywords you want to say, the points you want to hit. This approach may require you to edit a few seconds of dead air here and there, but the published narration will sound polished.

### Do a dress rehearsal

Have you ever conducted a workshop? Talked at a conference? Presented to your sixth grade class? You know how essential it is to practice your talk before showtime.

Same with egghead lessons. Before you hit record, explain your code example to yourself. Out loud. Enunciate! Be confident! Believe you’re the most qualified instructor in the history of egghead!

You’ll probably trip over your words. You might realize you know how to do something but not how to _articulate_ it. That’s okay—write notes to yourself and put your knowledge into words.

When it’s time to record, you’ll be more than ready.

# Speak concisely

By now, you know the drill: egghead lessons are short and to the point. That goes for the videos, which should be 1–10 minutes long. It also goes for your narration. Less is more.

Consider this example:

> Hello! Before we get started using Webpack you are going to need to install node. We are going to visit this URL and find the link to install it. Now we press "download" and we should get a file. We can now open that file and extract its contents. Now that node is installed, we can use npm to install webpack globally. Great. Now that webpack is installed globally, we can use it! Open up Sublime or your favorite editor to start working on the config.

Holy backstory! If you think back to our [cheesecake-stuffed cookie cake example](/what-makes-a-great-lesson), we don't have to explain or justify each step in the instruction. We can assume we’re delivering content to smart, capable humans who can fill in some blanks. We have to. There’s instructing to do, and the clock is ticking.

Without the over-instruction, we have a much more concise, energetic start to the lesson.

> We've got node already installed. Use npm to install webpack. Now run init and open the config to edit it.

Note how active those sentences are: _install webpack. Run init. Open the config_. Those are instructions.

### How much personality can we bring to our lessons?

Bring all your charm and favorite idioms to your narration _as long as they support your code example_. That’s what egghead learners come to see: good code. Use the [“show your work” trick](/the-show-your-work-trick) to determine if you should talk less, code more.

# The “show your work” trick

egghead lessons are concise by definition, but there’s another reason to keep your lessons sharply defined.

Too many ideas in one lesson means you’re glossing over concepts. Let’s say you mention “condition X could crash your app” because you want to cover your bases, yet you don’t take the time to really get into that subject. All you’ve accomplished is alarming your audience without giving them any solution.

### Show, don’t tell

_Show your work!_ You probably heard this when your high school math teacher forced you to write out the steps to a solution to get full credit for your answer.

It applies to coding instruction, too. The simple act of typing something out, highlighting a block with your mouse, or logging something in the console makes concepts infinitely more approachable.

If a user sees you walk through those steps, they gain confidence that they can do it, too. If they only hear you _talking_ about concepts, they can’t readily tie the concepts back to the code. Worse yet, they might stop paying attention altogether.

### Watch on mute

Here’s the trick: Turn off your audio and watch your lesson without sound.

It should be obvious from the visuals what you’re teaching. You may notice periods of 5+ seconds where nothing is happening. “Nothing” usually means you’re getting off-topic and thought it would be tough to _show_ what you’re talking about. When you catch a section of “nothing,” write down the topic you weren’t showing. Save it for another lesson!

![](https://www.cat-gifs.com/w3/CAT-GIF-Funny-Cat-watching-the-mouse-cursor-on-PC-monitor.gif)

With this one trick, you’ll quickly turn one lesson with a lot of tangents into a focused, concise lesson about one topic. Or if you’re interested in creating a course, those tangents could each be a separate lesson.

# Record and upload your lesson

Now that you know how to [be concise](/speak-concisely), [narrate your lesson](/how-to-instruct), and [show your work](/the-show-your-work-trick), it’s time to record for real.

### Recording your screencast

We’ve put together an entire Technical Guide to help you _record_ your screencasts. Find out how to:

- [Prepare your screen for recording](/prepare-your-screen-for-recording)
- [Set up your audio equipment](/set-up-your-audio)
- [Record and edit your lesson](/record-your-lesson)
- [Set up and share your code](/sharing-your-code)

Okay, that handles the specifics of recording. But the word _record_ is so...official. What if you mess up?

- **Make mistakes!** Your video isn't a live presentation. Mistakes and restarts are fine. Sometimes you need to cough, kids run through, a train rolls by. Edit it out later.

![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3oKIPoAP1wLvewc7QI/giphy.gif)

- Stumbling? Rambling? **Pause and think it through.** Pauses are SO easy to edit out.
- **Slow down**. Newbie instructors tend to rush through their lessons. Be slow and deliberate so learners can follow what you’re saying. Slowing down also helps your mouse keep up with your voice.

If you want a second pair of eyes before uploading your lesson, reach out to your coach on Slack. Or go ahead and upload, and you’ll get feedback after that. Remember, we’re here to support you and help you succeed!

### Upload your lesson

When your draft is complete, upload it to [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/). When you upload any lesson video, it’s automatically processed to make sure its audio is in stereo, the resolution is as expected, and that it’s uploaded to the appropriate storage channels.

You’ll almost certainly get feedback, ❗**_which isn’t the same as criticism_**❗ . Your coach knows exactly what we’re looking for and how to tweak lessons to get there. As you go through the editing process, ask your coach to screen share with you so you can get some guidance for the first pass. This can save you hours of trying to figure things out on your own! 🙂

Feedback in hand, you’ll be able to edit and update your video. When your coach gives you a thumbs up, you can update your lesson video for final review and publication.

Sometimes this can take a few minutes. If an hour goes by and your lesson video still isn’t visible, let us know!

### Lesson review and approval

Once you complete all the above steps, your lesson will be reviewed for approval. Reviewing means an experienced egghead instructor—someone other than your coach—will watch your lesson and provide feedback. It’s not uncommon that your lesson will require a couple of updates. Just record the required changes and replace the lesson’s video on egghead.

Then we publish! 🍾

# When we’ll publish your lesson

You’ve made it to the finish line. Hooray!

Once you’ve uploaded your lesson and gotten the official thumbs up, your lesson enters egghead’s lesson publishing queue.

The queue automatically publishes lessons from top to bottom. We publish several times per week and sometimes daily, depending on how many lessons are in the queue. This way, we make sure we’re keeping our subscribers happy with a steady stream of great content.

### New instructors

Lucky you—we move new instructors’ lessons to the top of the queue. This gives you a quick win after going through the process of recording your 30-second sample, making edits, recording your lesson for real, making _more_ edits, and finally getting that coveted approval.

You’ve come a long way. Celebrate!

### Experienced instructors

When an instructor has 12 published lessons, they gain the ability to review, approve, and publish their own content! Hot damn!

We trust you to make sure the quality of your lesson is high. You can still ask for review if you want it, or you can simply add your lesson to the publishing queue by approving it like a baller.

### Sharing your lesson on social media

After publishing, lessons are added to egghead’s social media sharing queue. This drives a lot of eyeballs to our lessons—our Twitter account has over 45,000 followers.

### That’s it!

You did it. You’re a published instructor.

Ready to do it all again?
