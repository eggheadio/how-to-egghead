We’ve put together an entire Technical Guide to help you _record_ your screencasts. Find out how to:

- [Prepare your screen for recording](/instructor/screencasting/screen-setup)
- [Set up your audio equipment](/instructor/screencasting/audio-equipment)
- [Record and edit your lesson](/instructor/screencasting)

Okay, that handles the specifics of recording. But the word _record_ is so...official. What if you mess up?

- **Make mistakes!** Your video isn't a live presentation. Mistakes and restarts are fine. Sometimes you need to cough, kids run through, a train rolls by. Edit it out later.

- Stumbling? Rambling? **Pause and think it through.** Pauses are SO easy to edit out.
- **Slow down**. Newbie instructors tend to rush through their lessons. Be slow and deliberate so learners can follow what you’re saying. Slowing down also helps your mouse keep up with your voice.

If you want a second pair of eyes before uploading your lesson, reach out to your coach on Slack. Or go ahead and upload, and you’ll get feedback after that. Remember, we’re here to support you and help you succeed!

### Upload your lesson

When your draft is complete, upload it to [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons_uploads/new). When you upload any lesson video, it’s automatically processed to make sure its audio is in stereo, the resolution is as expected, and that it’s uploaded to the appropriate storage channels.

You’ll almost certainly get feedback, ❗**_which isn’t the same as criticism_**❗ . Your coach knows exactly what we’re looking for and how to tweak lessons to get there. As you go through the editing process, ask your coach to screen share with you so you can get some guidance for the first pass. This can save you hours of trying to figure things out on your own! 🙂

Feedback in hand, you’ll be able to edit and update your video. When your coach gives you a thumbs up, you can update your lesson video for final review and publication.

Sometimes this can take a few minutes. If an hour goes by and your lesson video still isn’t visible, let us know!

### Lesson review and approval

Once you complete all the above steps, your lesson will be reviewed for approval. Reviewing means an experienced egghead instructor—someone other than your coach—will watch your lesson and provide feedback. It’s not uncommon that your lesson will require a couple of updates. Just record the required changes and replace the lesson’s video on egghead.

Then we publish! 🍾

# When we’ll publish your lesson

You’ve made it to the finish line. Hooray!

Once you’ve uploaded your lesson and gotten the official thumbs up, your lesson enters egghead’s lesson publishing queue.

The queue automatically publishes lessons from top to bottom. We publish several times per week and sometimes daily, depending on how many lessons are in the queue. This way, we make sure we’re keeping our subscribers happy with a steady stream of great content.

### New instructors

Lucky you—we move new instructors’ lessons to the top of the queue. This gives you a quick win after going through the process of recording your 30-second sample, making edits, recording your lesson for real, making _more_ edits, and finally getting that coveted approval.

You’ve come a long way. Celebrate!

### Experienced instructors

When an instructor has 12 published lessons, they gain the ability to review, approve, and publish their own content! Hot damn!

We trust you to make sure the quality of your lesson is high. You can still ask for review if you want it, or you can simply add your lesson to the publishing queue by approving it like a baller.

### Sharing your lesson on social media

After publishing, lessons are added to egghead’s social media sharing queue. This drives a lot of eyeballs to our lessons—our Twitter account has over 45,000 followers.

### That’s it!

You did it. You’re a published instructor.
