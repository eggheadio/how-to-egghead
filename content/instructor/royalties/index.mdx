egghead instructors are paid royalties for their work. When an egghead member watches a lesson its instructor gets paid. Instructors are paid for free community lessons as well as premium members only lessons.

The algorithm is relatively simple and was originally inspired by Spotify.

## How royalties work in detail

Royalties are paid at the beginning of the month, and reflect how many 30-second segments viewers watched in the previous month. We use PayPal or direct deposit to distribute royalties.

The amount youâ€™re paid depends on the overall gross subscription revenue, and how many 30-second segments were watched in total. We use this basic algorithm in Ruby:

```ruby
egghead_monthly_revenue  * ( your_segments / total_segments ) * royalty_percent
```

Royalties are pooled, so the more egghead members that watch your lessons, the more your monthly royalty check will be. This means that having a catalog of many useful lessons is the best way to increase your royalty checks!

We only send a check if your monthly royalties are above $100, otherwise we will keep track and send you a check when they reach $100.

Additionally egghead instructors are paid for live workshops and independent product launches in collaboration with egghead.
