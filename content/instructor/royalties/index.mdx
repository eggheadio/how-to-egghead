### How royalties work

Royalties are paid at the beginning of the month, and reflect how many 30-second segments viewers watched in the previous month. We use PayPal or direct deposit to distribute royalties.

The amount you’re paid depends on the overall gross subscription revenue, and how many 30-second segments were watched in total. We use this basic algorithm in Ruby:

```ruby
egghead_monthly_revenue  * ( your_segments / total_segments ) * royalty_percent
```

Royalties are pooled, so the more egghead members that watch your lessons, the more your monthly royalty check will be. This means that having a catalog of many useful lessons is the best way to increase your roaylty checks!

We only send a check if your monhtly royalties are above $100, otherwise we will keep track and send you a check when they reach $100.
