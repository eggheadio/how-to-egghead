Learner Advocates are at the front lines in egghead livestreams events. They show up and actively participate. Lots of times people are afraid to ask questions they want to be looked at a certain way. You're the example to show other attendees it's ok to ask questions 

Actively Participate some of these activites:

* Ask the questions in the chat or on video
* Take really good notes
* Provide links to resources in the chat mentioned ny instructor

## Asking questions for everyones benefit

In workshops some people are afraid to ask questions. Usually people be more comfortable asking questions when they see others doing so. 

As a Learner Advocate you are there to make everyone else comfortable asking questions and learn from the material. Once everyone is asking good questions without fear of being judged it enhances everyones experience! 

It also helps the instructor as well, when they ask "Does anyone have any questions?" and no one says anything they aren't able to get feedback to improve the workshop.

Asking for clarfication or what something means let the instructor go backa nd refine the material and that benefits the learners who takes the course afterwards.

Asking questions on video as to the personalization of the workshop. It's not mandatory but if you're comfortable go right ahead.


## Taking Really Good Notes

Take notes as you can. These will usually be light and not ultra detailed. We are aware it can be difficult to take great notes live.  

Notes for the live workshops will be put in a GitHub repo and be used for feedback for the intructor. Including questions from attendees their answer would be great as well.

## Providing Links to Resources 

When a instructor mentions a blog post, podcast, conference talks, book, etc, that's useful to the workshop try to go out and find it and post the url in the chat. This way everyone that wants can reference the material and learn even more.

You can also post the link to the Github repo we might be working out of, or any links to tools that might need to be downloaded. This let's the other learners focus on learning and the instuctors on instructing.

Ideally we would like to 3 Learner Advocates per workshop and these duties can be split and not overwhelm you.
